Information, schematics and software

<img src="img/kabel_vignette_r.JPG" alt="cables" width="40%"/>

This repo is my collection ideas and links concerning electronic music gear with focus on analog modular synths, microcontroller and MIDI modules and maybe FPGAs. And of course to develop own designs.

## Ideas for workshops

In 2023, an article was published on amazona.de ["Module vom Bausatz bis zur Eigenkreation"](https://www.amazona.de/workshop-eurorack-diy-module-vom-bausatz-bis-zur-eigenkreation/) (German, translated "Modules: From kits to own creations") that gives a very nice overview on the different levels you can construct your own modules. When organizing workshops, it probably makes sense to focus on entry ... medium level participants, teach some theory and of course give practical support and fix bugs. 

Please contact me if you are interested in collaborations, workshops or sharing some ideas!

* **Building a synthesizer module kit** like the [Erica Synths DIY kits](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/). For intermediate soldering and electronics skills, this should require 1/2 ... 1 day to complete and debug. However, you end up with a single module which could be underwhelming as a first synth experience.
* **Ray Wilson's Noise Toaster** is a compact semimodular synth, described in his book "Make: Analog Synthesizers" (see below). PCB and front panel are available via https://synthcube.com (UK). This is in the style of [Erica Synth's Bullfrog](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/standalone-instruments-1/bullfrog/). Maybe I redesign the synth to fit into a Eurorack and add some patch points etc. This also allows producing and ordering cheaper PCBs and front panels for a workshop.
* **[VCV-Rack](https://vcvrack.com/)**, a software emulation of modular synthesis. The possibilities and limitations of modular synth sound design can be explained and explored easily and for free as a first step. VCV-Rack can be used as a plug-in for DAWs, enabling interfacing audio and control signals to hardware modules and synths in a **hybrid synth**. This can help to avoid the initial single-module-sadness. Unfortunately, this is only possible with the pro-version.

  Alternatively, **[Disthro Cardinal](https://github.com/DISTRHO/Cardinal)** packages VCV-Rack together with the most popular modules and works as a plugin in AudioUnit/CLAP/LV2/VST2/VST3 formats and as a standalone app for FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, Windows and the Web.
* **PT2399 delay boards** are really cheap (1 ... 2 € at AliExpress) and can be used to build delay based effects for guitar players and modular synth afficionados, increasing the number of potential workshop participants. Examples and documentation see linked [here](pt2399.md).
* **Retro / LoFi** synths can be constructed with low effort for those who love the crispy sounds from the 8 bit era.
* **Free-style courses** starting with just a schematic for advanced synthesizer developers / electronic tinkerers. Breadboards work well for the complexity level of a typical synth module, and from this a stripline board or a PCB can be designed and manufactured.
* **Faust + ESP32** audio platform (see below), focussing on algorithms and a software-centric approach to music electronics, suitable for stomp boxes and modular systems alike.
* **Arduino / Teensy** (see below) + some analog interfacing

### Locations & durations

Maker spaces, technical museums, universities, synth shops, synth fairs or conferences, ... ranging from 1/2 day to several days / evenings either in a row or once a week.

## Digital Hardware and Components

* [Raspberry Pi Pico: Grundlagen der Energieversorgung / Stromversorgung](https://www.elektronik-kompendium.de/sites/raspberry-pi/2611061.htm), how to power a RPi Pico from (German) via Micro-USB connector, VBUS pin, 3V3 pin or VSYS pin without frying it
* [**EuroPi**](https://github.com/Allen-Synthesis/EuroPi) is a module based on the Raspberry Pi Pico that can be reprogrammed in MicroPython.

### Arduino

* [**Arduino Beat Detector**](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/mamifero/881c722e-1049-4d82-a91d-56f000ed7b60), using just a coupling capacitor and simple IIR filters to extract beat timing from audio data

### Teensy

[Teensy boards](teensy/teensy.md) are widely used low-cost, high-performance ARM M7 based microcontroller boards. Besides general purpose projects, Teensies are frequently used for audio applications due to good software libraries and a fast USB port.

### Daisy Seed

[Daisy Seed boards](daisy.md) have been used for a lot of audio and synth projects due to their high-performance ARM processors and on-board HiFi-grade ADCs and DACs, unfortunately they are not so easily available and pricey in Germany.

### ESP32

[ESP32 modules and boards](esp32.md) give the most "bang for the buck" you can get, drawbacks are an overwhelming variety of boards and revisions and a lower quality of audio libraries for music making compared to Teensy and Daisy Seed.

### OWL (Open Ware Laboratory)

The OWL platform is an Open Source [Software](https://github.com/RebelTechnology/OpenWare) and [Hardware](https://www.openwarelab.org/), community-driven signal processing platform. Rebeltech builds and sells fully programmable pedals and Eurorack modules like the [Genius](https://www.rebeltech.org/product/genius/) based on this platform.

### FPGAs

[Open Hardware Eurorack Compatible Audio FPGA Front End](https://hackaday.com/2023/02/13/an-open-hardware-eurorack-compatible-audio-fpga-front-end/) is a really cool project, built around a AK4619VN four-channel audio codec providing four analog inputs and four analog outputs on a narrow module. Sample code for an Icebreaker FPGA (Lattice) board is provided and all files are on [Github](https://github.com/schnommus/eurorack-pmod). There is even a [Plugin](https://github.com/schnommus/verilog-vcvrack) allowing to run Verilog code inside the VCV Rack audio simulator!

## Languages for Digital Audio

### Faust

> [Faust](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/) (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing with a strong focus on the design of synthesizers, musical instruments, audio effects, etc. It is used in the academia and, of course, by musicians.

Faust has been implemented on low-cost uC platforms like ESP32 and Teensy, some of my experiences and experiments will be linked [here](faust.md).

### PureData (pd)

[PureData](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pure_Data&wprov=rarw1) is a visual programming language for creating interactive computer music and multimedia. It is an open source project and was originally developed by Miller Puckette who also developed Max.

pd describe data-flow systems where objects on a visual canvas receive, process and transmit atomic data types.

There is support for Daisy platforms via [pd2dsy](https://github.com/electro-smith/pd2dsy).

[libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd) packs puredata as an embeddable audio synthesis library.

The [Pduino](ttps://at.or.at/hans/pd/objects.html) object provides Firmata-based access where [Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/arduino) is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a host computer. Alternatively, you can control the Teensy via USB MIDI messages.

### PlugData

[plugdata](https://plugdata.org/) is a visual programming environment for PureData.

### Max/MSP

Due to common history, [Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_%28software%29) is quite similar to pd and also describes data-flow systems. However, it is a commercial software published by [Cycling74](https://cycling74.com/) which have been acquired by Ableton in 2017.

[Gen](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/vignettes/gen_topic) is an extension for the Max environment that allows compiling visual code into a more efficient binary form that can also be exported outside the Max environment. for more details see a tutorial on the [gen~](https://cycling74.com/tutorials/gen~-for-beginners-part-1-a-place-to-start) object.

[Maxuino](http://www.maxuino.org/) supports Teensy running StandardFirmata.
