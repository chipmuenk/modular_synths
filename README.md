# modular_synths
Information, schematics and software for modular synths

<img src="img/kabel_vignette_r.JPG" alt="cables" width="40%"/>

The idea behind this repo is to collect ideas and links concerning electronic music gear using analog modular synths, MIDI modules and maybe FPGAs. And of course to develop own designs.

## Ideas for workshops
In 2023, an article was published on amazona.de ["Module vom Bausatz bis zur Eigenkreation"](https://www.amazona.de/workshop-eurorack-diy-module-vom-bausatz-bis-zur-eigenkreation/) (German, translated "Modules: From kits to own creations") that gives a very nice overview on the different levels you can construct your own modules. When organizing workshops, it probably makes sense to focus on entry level courses, provideing some theory and of course practical support.

* Construction of a complete module kit, like the [Erica Synths DIY kits](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/). For intermediate soldering and electronics skills, this should require 1/2 ... 1 day to complete and debug. However, you end up with a single module which could be underwhelming.
* Compact semimodular synth in the style of [Erica Synth's Bullfrog](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/standalone-instruments-1/bullfrog/) or Ray Wilson's Noise Toaster.
* Hybrid Synth with VCV-Rack


### Locations
Maker spaces, technical museums, universities, synth shops, synth fairs or conferences, ...

Together with [Erica Synths](https://www.ericasynths.lv/) he even developed a series of educational DIY synth modules [mki x es.EDU](https://www.ericasynths.lv/news/mki-x-esedu/).
* [**Look Mum No Computer**](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/) and especially his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LOOKMUMNOCOMPUTER/videos) breathe a true punky DIY spirit!  Many designs are described and can be bought at his [KosmoModularGrid Shop](https://www.kosmodulargrid.com/).
* **Kevin's** [Simple DIY Electro Music Projects](https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com) and his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SimpleDIYElectroMusicProjects) provide tons of information on music electronics, especially for Arduino and RPi Pico.
* [**Michael ZÃ¼lch**](https://github.com/mzuelch/CATs-Eurosynth) has a lot of analog and Arduino based modules on his Github Repo, complete with KiCAD files.
* **Bamanya Brian** from Uganda is a true DIY synth guy, on his [Afrorack Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPfBqZQ2P8NqY7puxYzirtw) he shows what he calls [Africa's first home made modular synth](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ov2sEfUv1XY), what it's like to [how to make cheap synth modules](https://youtube.com/watch?v=eELTtd9Bv-k) and demonstrates [some African rhythms on modular synth](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RhWh21uvUZo). He also shows [how to make a MIDI to CV converter for 5$](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UYeJiPWZZNQ).
* [**Notes and Volts**](https://www.notesandvolts.com/) and his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/NotesAndVolts) have lots of interesting audio projects, mainly built around uCs like the Teensy.
* [**Rene Schmitz**](https://www.schmitzbits.de/) Schmitzbits is a treasure trove for analog synth related circuits.
* [**Raymond Schouten**](www.rs-elc.nl) has some very reduced but interesting projects for mixed analog / Arduino synthesizers.
* Last but not least: The Subreddit [**/r/synthdiy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/synthdiy)

## Mechanics

* 3D-printed front panels on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/de/model/14009-mper-mostly-printed-euro-rack)

## Analog Hardware


## MIDI
[Electrical specification and interfaces](midi_phy.md)

### MIDI to CV converter
* [MIDI to CV Skull](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-midi-to-cv-skull), a MIDI to CV converter shaped like a skull (well ...) using an RPI Pico with an MCP4725 I2C 12 bit DAC (CircuitPython)
* [Basic MIDI to CV converter](https://www.hackster.io/janost/diy-good-ol-midi-to-cv-d0e2bf) using an AT Tiny and PWM (C)

### MIDI routing and decoding
* **Sparkfun** has a great [introduction}(https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/midi-tutorial/all)
* **Kevin's diyelectromusic** has a great set of basic MIDI project tutorials on a RPi Pico with Micropython to be up and running in no time at all:
  * [MIDI (out), MicroPython and the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/midi-micropython-and-the-raspberry-pi-pico/), a "Hello World" project to write some MIDI commands.
  * [MIDI In for 3.3V Microcontrollers](https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2021/02/15/midi-in-for-3-3v-microcontrollers/) is counterpart
  * [Raspberry Pi Pico MIDI Channel Router](https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2021/06/13/raspberry-pi-pico-midi-channel-router/) routes a MIDI In port to one of 8 MIDI Out ports, utilizing a.o. the RPi PIO functionality.  With detailled explanation of channel decoding - funtastic!
  * [Raspberry Pi Pico MIDI Channel Merger](https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2021/12/19/raspberry-pi-pico-midi-channel-merger/) works the other way round, merging signals from eight MIDI Inputs to one MIDI output.
  * [Raspberry Pi Pico Multi MIDI Router](https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2021/12/28/raspberry-pi-pico-multi-midi-router/) is a five part project for a general 6-IN, 6-OUT MIDI routing device.

## uC
* [Raspberry Pi Pico: Grundlagen der Energieversorgung / Stromversorgung](https://www.elektronik-kompendium.de/sites/raspberry-pi/2611061.htm), how to power a RPi Pico from (German) via Micro-USB connector, VBUS pin, 3V3 pin or VSYS pin without frying it
* [**EuroPi**](https://github.com/Allen-Synthesis/EuroPi) is a module based on the Raspberry Pi Pico that can be reprogrammed in MicroPython..
* [**Arduino Beat Detector**](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/mamifero/881c722e-1049-4d82-a91d-56f000ed7b60), using just a coupling capacitor and simple IIR filters to extract beat timing from audio data

## Faust
> [Faust](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/) (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing with a strong focus on the design of synthesizers, musical instruments, audio effects, etc. It is used in the academia and, of course, by musicians.

Faust has been implemented on low-cost uC platforms like ESP32 and Teensy and used as a base for hardware-oriented workshops:

## FPGAs

[Open Hardware Eurorack Compatible Audio FPGA Front End](https://hackaday.com/2023/02/13/an-open-hardware-eurorack-compatible-audio-fpga-front-end/) is a really cool project, built around a AK4619VN four-channel audio codec providing four analog inputs and four analog outputs on a narrow module. Sample code for an Icebreaker FPGA (Lattice) board is provided and all files are on [Github](https://github.com/schnommus/eurorack-pmod). There is even a [Plugin](https://github.com/schnommus/verilog-vcvrack) allowing to run Verilog code inside the VCV Rack audio simulator!
