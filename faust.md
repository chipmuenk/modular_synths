# Faust

> [Faust](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/) (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing with a strong focus on the design of synthesizers, musical instruments, audio effects, etc. It is used in the academia and, of course, by musicians.

Faust has also been implemented on low-cost uC platforms like ESP32 and Teensy.

It can be and is used as a base for hardware-oriented workshops:

## Hardware

The [ESP32 Audio Kit v2.2 A247](https://docs.ai-thinker.com/en/esp32-audio-kit) board, available for ca. 15 â‚¬ at [Aliexpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/i/33003284057.html), ticked all the right boxes for me: A powerful and widely used processor, audio codec included and lots of audio interfaces. The board is built around the [ESP32-A1S Audio break-out board](https://docs.ai-thinker.com/en/esp32-a1s) which also can/could be bought stand-alone.
The break-out board contains an ESP32-WROVER module, that is an ESP32-D0WDQ6-V3 chip with external 4 MB SPI Flash and 8 MB PSRAM. The "A1S" suffix relates to the CODEC that is cconnected via I2S. My version contains an ES8388 chip replacing the AC101 CODEC in older versions.

Besides the ESP32-A1S break-out board, the Audio Kit encompasses:
- CP2102 USB2UART bridge
- 2 onboard microphones
- stereo headphone output, stereo line-in input
- 2 NS4150 Class D audio amplifiers for two speaker outputs (3W, 4 &Omega;)
- 6 general purpose push buttons

## First project
As a "Hello World" I tried to implement the Faust ESP32 example on https://faustdoc.grame.fr/tutorials/esp32/. 

I used VSCode as a code editor with the [Microsoft C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack) (which also installs CMake Tools) and the [Espressif IDF Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=espressif.esp-idf-extension).

In Visual Studio Code, select menu "View" and "Command Palette" and type [ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension]. After that, you can also choose where to save settings in the setup wizard.

As the Faust tutorial describes the older version of the board, some details need to be changed as described by [pschatzmann](https://www.pschatzmann.ch/home/2021/12/06/the-ai-thinker-audio-kit-experience-or-nothing-is-right/)
and in [ESP32 Audio Kit Grundlagen](https://radio-bastler.de/forum/showthread.php?tid=17786) (German). The differences between the AC101 and the ES8388 version are described in more detail in https://www.docdroid.net/L6LX9SK/esp32-a1s-esv23zh-cnen-pdf and in https://github.com/marcel-licence/esp32_midi_sampler/discussions/50 .
