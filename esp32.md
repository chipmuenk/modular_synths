# Synth Projects on ESP32
## Hackerbox Audio DSP
> Welcome to HackerBox 0079. Let's explore audio signal generation, inter-IC sound (I2S) audio streams, and digital signal processing (DSP). Configure an ESP32-A1S Audio Development Kit featuring a dual-core ESP32 microcontroller coupled to an integrated audio CODEC and a variety of audio interface and peripheral components. Program several audio processing examples leveraging an advanced stream-based hardware abstraction layer for the ESP32-A1S. Examples include wave generators, simple synthesizers, MP3 decoders for online stream sources as well as MP3 files on SD flash cards. Use GNU Octave (or MATLAB) to design and test digital FIR filters that can be implemented on the ESP32 Audio Development Kit. Hack multi-channel audio connectors:

## Marcel License
Marcel License's repo at https://github.com/marcel-licence has a lot of great music projects built around ESP-32:

### Little startup guide for ESP32 Arduino DIY MIDI Synthesizer Projects
A great [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ZNxGCB-d68g) video to get started with Arduino IDE and git and Marcel's audio projects.

### ESP32 based DIY polyphonic MIDI synthesizer module
The project is published on [Github](https://github.com/marcel-licence/esp32_basic_synth) and demonstrated on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/5XVK5MOKmZw). It has been tested on the ESP32 Audio Kit v2.2 (see above) and on the widely used ESP32 DEVKIT - DOIT. 

The project also uses the following software by the same author:

### USB MIDI for the ESP32
